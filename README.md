# Next_Word_Prediciton

This project is a Next Word Predictor built using an LSTM model. It predicts the next word in a sentence based on WhatsApp chat data.

#Overview

Data: Exported WhatsApp chat messages.
Model: An LSTM neural network trained on the chat data.
Goal: Predict the next word after a given phrase.

#How It Works

Data Collection: Export WhatsApp chat and clean the data to remove timestamps and other non-text elements.
Training the Model: Use LSTM layers to learn patterns from the chat messages.
Making Predictions: Input a phrase, and the model suggests the next likely word.
